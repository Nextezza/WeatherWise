## Features

The API provides dynamic suggestions based on real-time weather data, focusing on the following categories:

1. **Clothes Suggestions**: 
   - Recommendations on what to wear depending on the current temperature.
   - Example: Coats for cold weather, light clothes for hot weather.

2. **Activity Suggestions**: 
   - Suggestions for suitable indoor or outdoor activities based on weather conditions.
   - Example: Stay indoors on rainy days, enjoy outdoor sports on sunny days.

3. **Health Suggestions**: 
   - Tips to stay safe and comfortable in varying weather conditions.
   - Example: Stay hydrated in hot weather, wear warm clothes in cold conditions.
